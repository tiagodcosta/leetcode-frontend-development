## Challenge 01
====

You have a form with a submit button `<button type="submit">Submit</button>` that uses the event listener onMouseDown to trigger the submit logic.

The problem is that your project manager came with new data about the users. Most of the visitors of your website do not use a mouse. 
Some of them even use a stylus pen to interact with the website. 

How can you solve that in a way that you cover all users (mobile/desktop/mouse/pen)? 
Accoring to your project manager, all the users should be able to active the button submit and send their information regardless of their device or size screen.

Tip: You should explore the correct event listeners.
